### Project Description

We intend to compare Uber pickups with Medallion pickups in New York City during time intervals Apr-Sept 2014 and Jan-Jun 2015, to be consistent with the Uber data provided by [FiveThirtyEight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/uber-tlc-foil-response). We are interested in finding out what kind of  potential impacts that the two services may have on each other across different neighborhoods in NYC.
